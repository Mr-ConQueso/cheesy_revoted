<p>Cheesy's Revoted Ideas adds all the features announced from 2017 until today with some additions and total customization.</p>
<p>The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to set up contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>
<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you through all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>
